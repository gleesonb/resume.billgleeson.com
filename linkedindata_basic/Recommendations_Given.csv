Abdel Jalil,Aboufariss,NextEra Energy Resources,Cloud Principal Architect,"I had the privilege of working with Abdel during his time at RBI as we implemented CloudFix solutions across their cloud infrastructure. Abdel's technical expertise and strategic vision were exceptional - he personally automated over $500K in annual savings and drove approximately $1.5 million in total cost reductions during our time working together. What impressed me most was how efficiently he adopted CloudFix's recommendations, implementing them faster and more thoroughly than almost any other customer I've worked with. His valuable technical feedback has continued to shape our product development to this day. Abdel's deep understanding of cloud architecture, combined with his practical approach to cost optimization, created a partnership that benefited both organizations. His work at RBI stands as a perfect example of how the right expertise can maximize the potential of cost optimization tools","03/21/25, 05:42 PM",
