Phil,Sayers,Proten Sales Development Ltd,Founder,"I worked with Bill throughout my time at Scapa.     He’s very capable from a technical perspective and combines this with a strong customer focus. As a result, irrespective of whether he was working with me in a sales, pre-sales or post-sales consultancy capacity, I always had the confidence that he would strive to find solutions that were in the best interest of the customer and our company.    I have no hesitation in recommending Bill.","06/15/09, 03:49 AM",VISIBLE
