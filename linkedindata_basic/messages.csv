Abdel's technical expertise and strategic vision were exceptional - he personally automated over $500K in annual savings and drove approximately $1.5 million in total cost reductions during our time working together. What impressed me most was how efficiently he adopted CloudFix's recommendations, implementing them faster and more thoroughly than almost any other customer I've worked with. His valuable technical feedback has continued to shape our product development to this day. Abdel's deep understanding of cloud architecture, combined with his practical approach to cost optimization, created a partnership that benefited both organizations. His work at RBI stands as a perfect example of how the right expertise can maximize the potential of cost optimization tools",INBOX,

As some of you might know, I've recently completed a 2-year cycle at Trilogy as SVP of Software Engineering. After a well-deserved break to reflect on my future career paths, I've decided to resume my entrepreneurial life after 9 years of corporate experience and start a fully AI-driven software factory from scratch. More on that soon!  The reason I'm writing this message is that I've always regarded social networking as more of a distraction than anything else, and haven't really dedicated much effort or time to it. This started changing when I was having a discussion with a potential future customer, and he mentioned that my LinkedIn profile didn't showcase any particular skill or experience that would encourage them to contract us.  Maybe naively, I was NOT considering that my yet-to-be-born company would be so closely associated with me as an individual, despite my efforts to define its identity and clear processes.  I assume this will change at some point in the future, but in the meantime, I have a special request.  You're receiving this message because we've had a meaningful work relationship in the past, maybe recently, maybe not. I would like you to take a few minutes to scavenge your memories and write a recommendation about your work experience with me. But there's a catch! Please emphasize both the GOOD and BAD things that you can recall.  Yes, I don't want this to be regarded as a job applicant recommendation, but as a transparent X-ray of who I am as a person and professional so anyone can know what the DNA of my future company comes from.  I thank you in advance for your time so far and hope that in this new journey we have the opportunity to reconnect!",INBOX,

CloudFix is pretty quiet tbh. All of the focus went on Rightspend. We've a couple of RS deals over the line (small ones) but the core CF product has wilted, very few new customers. Holding on to renewals is difficult too, so plenty of scope for a man of your talents if you come back. There is only one  other commercial guy at CF now - Tim Galloway. He's working at SVP level on big deals and a lot of the everyday activities that were feeding the pipeline aren't happening. So we need that to start up again.  BTW everyone has gone AI crazy here so make sure to mention that you're super skilled at using AI to offload busy work to free yourself up for human centric work Brandon has been CEO since March.

My experience with Crossover has been mostly positive. Their recruitment process was thorough and I felt that they were looking for candidates who genuinely fit the roles. If you are successful, you're a contractor and payment is weekly in USD, it's up to you to manage that.  The WorkSmart tool does monitor work through screenshots, and keylogging. It took some getting used to, but I don't really think about it that much now. They do like to grind the hours, and if you're based in .ei you'll generally be expected to cover US hours. Again, something I just got used to quickly enough.   I do enjoy working with the CloudFix product - it's genuinely interesting - and I enjoy working with the product and sharing the vision of the company with customers.   The management is competent, with a clear direction for the company. We're pretty flat hierarchy these days after a couple of fairly brutal and sudden restructures over the last 9 months. As with any team, there can be disagreements, but I've found that they're open to feedback and discussions.  The reviews out there are a mixed bag, but my own experience has been mostly positive. Best of luck with the application. If it's for one of the senior sales positions, very high-level contacts with the huge AWS customers (like Salesforce I guess) will be a must.  regards  Bill",INBOX,

I just wanted to let you know about where I've ended up. I'm working with cloudfix.com - they have got a nice product that scans accounts for easy no downtime fixes (think switching on S3 Intelligent tiering or automatically converting gp2 to gp3). Recently found $650k of annual savings for a single US customer. Can be switched on in the marketplace. It may be of interest to some of your customers, I know you guys like to talk about cost optimisation :). Anyway, I hope you're enjoying life in AWS and that the family are all well. Bill",INBOX,

They goal as you may remember was to sell the company and for the evil investors and Mike, Dave etc to disappear into the sunset. We were courted by various suitors and in about 2009 Quest Software led us up the aisle, but ditched us at the altar.  This left Scapa up shit creek, as there was no money left, no forthcoming sales etc.   So Armen, Derek, myself, Antony and Iain the sales guy went to the board and suggested that the 5 of us take the company forward. This meant getting rid of Mike, Dave etc. Dave stayed on the board though to represent the old investors.  A couple of the evil investors saw that the game was up and left around that time.  We got rid of the office and started working from home. We had enough customers to keep the 5 of us going and did alright for a few years after that. Antony left after a while though, and we got Neil, who had been freelancing for us, back in.   We never really hired anyone else, or to be honest did anything too different, and managed to keep trundling along until now.   I left in 2019 to work locally here in Dublin, but continued to help out.

As well as any in Ireland. I've got in touch with you as I see you used to work in the UK for many years, and likely have some old UK pension assets.  For Irish residents, the following benefits are the main reason to look at and get Irish based advice on your UK pensions:  1. Currency Fluctuations - is a £GBP asset going to give you a consistent €EUR value? 2. Earlier access. Option of 55 instead of 65 3. Control of how and when you receive money - on your timeline not the pension trustee - helping you control any annual taxation you have to manage 4. Trustees no longer have control of this pension and the asset is now in your name 5. Probate avoided if anything happens to you, your family receives this fund tax free 6. More control of the investment of your pension funds- funds will generate better returns than default funds. 7. Ongoing annual service of your pension  Here is a Q & A on our website which gives some more detail: https://elevatefinancial.ie/qa-transferring-a-uk-pension-to-ireland/  Here is also a piece our Managing Director wrote for the Irish Examiner regarding old Irish pensions.  https://www.irishexaminer.com/business/economy/arid-40714772.html  If this something you'd like to have a look at please let me know when you would be free for a call.

I just wanted to touch in and see how business has been for yourself over the past 6 months?  I previously spoke with you in February with regards to additional salespeople. You mentioned to me at that time that Scapa was not actively seeking new business, however you may look to explore new markets in the latter half of the year. Is this something that is still of interest to you? If you are looking to add to your team, it would be great to arrange a call to discuss how I can help.  Please let me know if this is something you wish to explore and I will get something pencilled in to the diary.  Kind regards, Ross",INBOX,

And that's where it stops.  It might surprise you to learn this, but my prodigious technical skills dont extend to anything that resembles app development. So I thought a young go getter like yourself might know someone who'd have enough about them, and the time, to knock together a mvp for us. There are a lot of elements to the design we have, we'd need someone cloudy as well as front end.  If you know of anyone that has been faced with a bit of spare time, or even want a few more details so you can poke fun at the scope and  design get in touch.

My expertise is to help you at a particularly important stage of life, to protect your income in the event that you can no longer provide due to ill health or other reasons.  Without the proper protection in place, such as life cover, income protection, specified illness and mortgage protection, your current or future income may be difficult to replace.   These policies can provide a level of comfort for you, your spouse and your family when planned in advance.  And it may be more affordable than you think...  We offer advice on the full range of protection products and we now have an exciting offering for you which works within your budget.   We can provide you with one quote, capped at a budget which you set, that suits your pocket but covers a multiple of the protection policies mentioned above.   We could potentially quote you for level term life assurance, specified illness cover and Income protection, which gives you multiple cover for a single premium.   Not only do we work within your budget but some policies qualify for tax relief which offers even better value for money.   I would be glad to discuss a quote based on your current needs or perhaps we could meet and offer you a full free financial review.   I look forward to hearing from you at your convenience.  - Éibhear",INBOX,

This could address an off the shelf type market that we've missed for years.    The Nakivo partnership hasn't really taken off tbh, we thought it would be complementary, but most organisations we deal with would usually have a solution in place. We'll probably run out the duration of the agreement.    Are you still in the wilds of the West Coast? I'm over in Dublin now, but am over and back quite a lot.

At a smart anniversary party in London we find absent hosts, eccentric, confused guests, gunshots, a police investigation and fast-developing chaos all round. It’s the setting for some of Simon's most brilliantly funny, laugh-a-minute writing.   At the Royal Scots Club, Abercromby Place (venue 241)  Monday August 11th – Saturday August 16th at 20:30 (ends 22:00)  Tickets £12 (£10 concessions)   You can buy tickets in advance direct from me (the advantage being that Arkle get the face value amount of the ticket), and I accept cash, cheques, RBS mobile app payments, direct transfers…  Or you can book a ticket via me and pay (cash only) at the venue.

Likewise, data growth has been exploding for some time and so have the opportunities to lose that data - thus reliable backup is more important than ever before for your business to continue to run if something should happen.     Unitrends is the leader and #1 provider for Unified Backup Appliances - backup appliances that back up physical, virtual and cloud servers through one tool and interface.  By doing this, Unitrends saves you and your team:    1) A huge amount of time spent on the backup process - this process is tedious and time consuming, especially amongst several platforms    2) Lots of money due to not having to maintain, pay support, and manage several types of backup software    3) Lots more money by reducing the amount of data backed up by a large amount, allowing you to use far less of your expensive storage for backup.     4) A lot of headaches - by doing everything in a single pane of glass, Unitrends gives you a ""one throat to choke"" approach to backup. A single point of accountability also provides a quicker resolution so you can get back up and running.    5) Confidence in the reliability of your backed up data - Unitrends has a 99% customer satisfaction rate for a reason. Unitrends also *replicates* to another Unitrends appliance or to CLOUD to provide an extremely reliably DR plan    If the Unitrends solution sounds like a potential good fit for your data protection challenges and you're open to learning more please let me know.

(If you’re not interested, just delete the message – It’s just a quick update, with more detail attached for those who have recently asked me how we’re doing.)       As we all know, business success is all about sales.  ""Nothing happens until somebody sells something,"" the old quote goes.  Well, WinGreen's reason for existence is to help companies meet and beat sales goals through effective pipeline growth.  We do this by providing outsourced online lead generation, and we've demonstrated that our system of marketing delivers 3X to 8X more leads at 40% to 80% lower cost per lead.  Now we're ready to go to full production and we're looking for customers who want to cost-effectively build healthy sales pipelines.    First, a company update:  We're thrilled to announce that we recently added Mike McGinn to the executive team as Sr. VP of Sales.  (For Mike's bio, see http://wingreenmarketing.com/ExecutiveBios.aspx.)     Second, a status update:  WinGreen Marketing Systems has completed its software platform implementation and beta testing, and is now actively seeking new clients in technology industries like IT, telecom, and cleantech with anywhere from $20M to $200M in revenues.  Our outsourced content marketing services are ideal for quickly building and sustaining sales pipelines and growing sales.  So, if you know anyone who fits those company profiles and who is looking for a way to increase sales pipelines, please pass along this email to them.    Finally, for those who are interested in the details of the services now available, an overview of our updated features and benefits is below my signature.  If the details don’t interest you, then no need to read further…  My purpose is certainly not to waste anyone’s time, but rather to just stay connected and keep you up to date.    -Don-    Don Montgomery  Managing Partner  WinGreen Marketing Systems  http://www.WinGreenMarketing.com  d.montgomery@wingreenmarketing.com  Office:  (610) 810-1707      ================================================================    WinGreen is an outsourced marketing services provider.  We can take on the entire role of online lead generation, and deliver high-quality, self-identified leads who are explicitly interested in your products or services.  We do this by (1) creating content, (2) promoting content into your target markets, (3) capturing interested leads, and (4) enabling your sales people to be more efficient and effective in prospect follow-up.      Benefits:  - Enough leads for each salesperson to be successful  - More leads than conventional or in-house methods  - Higher quality leads   - Lower cost per lead  - No need to acquire technology for online marketing  - No need to distract people from their real jobs to create content every month  - No more missed schedules due to internal fire drills     Features include all of the following:    - All WinGreen services are fixed monthly fee (after a one-time setup fee).  The monthly fee covers all content, software, hardware, labor, and database creation, as listed below:    - Client Account Manager -- WinGreen assigns a marketing professional to your account to work with you to create key messages, selling propositions, and campaigns.    - WinPlan 3-6-12 Campaign Organizer -- WinGreen's unique rolling campaign scheduler shows you details for the next three months, themes for the next six months, and placeholders for all 12 months.      - All target contact data.  Your Client Account Manager works with you to define your targets and objectives, then acquires contact emails in sufficient volume to achieve the objectives.      - Outbound bulk email.  WinGreen emails your promotions to hundreds of thousands of contacts in your target segments.    - Content creation for all campaigns.  WinGreen authors your white papers, newsletters, Google Ads, and webcasts.  You own the copyrights.  Your campaigns get done on time every month, but you don't have to scramble to find people to write white papers or speak on webcasts.  We do it for you, put your brand on it, use it for your lead gen campaigns, and turn over the content to you to use any other way you wish.    - Integrated Google AdWords.  We can manage your Google AdWords and integrate all incoming Google Ad leads directly into our automated system.    - WinGreen creates custom landing pages on your website for each campaign.    - All required software and hardware is in the WinGreen Systems Architecture.  No IT investment or administration required by the client!    - Webcast hosting software for monthly webcasts and web seminars is included in the WinGreen Systems Architecture.  No separate fees to Webex, Citrix, or other providers!     - Fully automated lead capture.  Your interested leads click through and arrive at your custom landing page to a pre-filled form, and ask for the content in which they're interested.  All contact info is seamlessly and automatically delivered into the sales portal for follow-up.  Contact (lead) information is automatically de-duplicated on the fly!      - Lead Scoring.  WinGreen's automated systems score each incoming lead based on his or her total activities (e.g. click-through, web page visits, repeat visits, etc.)    - Sales enablement.  The WinGreen client portal is built on the Salesforce.com platform, so your salespeople get full CRM functionality included with our lead gen service.  WinGreen customization includes one-click access to prospects’ LinkedIn profiles, one-click access to see which of your web pages your prospect has visited, on-screen viewing of all campaign, email, and contact history for the prospect, and integrated call and meeting logging, notes, email repository, tracking, forecasting, and reporting.  (Using a different CRM than Salesforce?  No problem.  We'll integrate lead generation from our systems into yours.)    - Lead Nurturing.  70% of new leads are discarded by salespeople because they're not ready to purchase within the qualification time period.  WinGreen's portal provides your salesperson with automated lead nurturing. Instead of discarding leads who are interested but not timely, your salespeople simply click ""Nurture"", and those leads will receive a steady ""drip"" of nurturing emails – one to three per month --  designed to keep them  interested and ""warm"" until such time as they're ready to purchase.

Quite agressive timescales thrown in the mix as well. The workload was heavy, but the customer is very happy with how it has gone and we are now settling in to a five year support contract.    You may also be aware, we sold out to Capita a few months back. Our former Chairman has just left the business so the merger is starting to gather pace.    How are you finding Account Management?

The amount raised for the renal unit was about £3,000 with both online and offline donations.    I completed the Ironman UK course in 11:28:58. It was probably one of the toughest events I've ever entered and I was aching quite badly in places I didn't know existed. I am very pleased with my time and was especially pleased with my marathon time of 3:39.    As well as your support, the people of Bolton and the event organisers made a massive effort to ensure all athletes had an excellent day. The weather helped out too, being dry throughout the day - although it was quite windy in places (and not just because of too many lentils :). There was a grandstand finish in the town centre with the organisers ensuring all athletes got to know that they were now IRONMEN !! Very cool.    I've added a link for the Ironman web site below which includes all the results and there should be photos - I'm number 425 but there are some better looking people with other numbers..... Once again thank you very much.    http://www.iron.ironmanuk.com",ARCHIVE,

Could you direct me towards the person in your company who would be curious to have a chat about free AWS resources?  Best regards, Tuukka",,

Hence we truly know the challenges. What can I offer to you today: every startup can receive up to 100K USD in free AWS credits through its lifecycle to use the services, and as an AWS partner, we help scout startups for this program. If you’re using AWS or planning a transfer, credits can be a real game-changer for you.   Would that be of interest? I’m ready to tell you more.  Cheers, Tuukka",,
